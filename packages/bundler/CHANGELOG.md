### Patch Changes

- [#20](https://github.com/Lazialize/oasis/pull/20) [`d1d74d9`](https://github.com/Lazialize/oasis/commit/d1d74d9c9162801b8ba1352bf2690ee77d7583fe) Thanks [@Lazialize](https://github.com/Lazialize)! - Fix bundling of Path Item Objects in webhook and callback positions. Root-level 3.1 `webhooks`
  entries and the runtime-expression entries of a Callback Object are now recognized as Path Item
  slots: a path-item `$ref` there is inlined in place (with 3.1 `summary`/`description` siblings
  preserved) instead of being invalidly lifted into `components`. A `$ref` at `callbacks/<name>`
  (a whole Callback Object) still lifts into `components/callbacks`, and refs inside an inlined path
  item are still lifted normally.

## 0.8.2

### Patch Changes

- [#18](https://github.com/Lazialize/oasis/pull/18) [`8060414`](https://github.com/Lazialize/oasis/commit/8060414c1f890f599b820dfe93c8c9f94c5b1435) Thanks [@Lazialize](https://github.com/Lazialize)! - Fix four `$ref`/pointer handling bugs: (1) a `$ref`'s file and fragment parts are now percent-decoded (`./petstore%20v2.yaml` resolves the file `petstore v2.yaml`; fragment segments are percent-decoded before `~1`/`~0` unescaping), tolerating a malformed `%` instead of throwing; (2) a literal `{"$ref": ...}` value nested under a schema's `example`/`default`/`enum`/`const` (or a 3.1 `examples` array) is treated as plain data instead of a reference, so it no longer triggers a spurious unresolved-ref diagnostic during graph loading or gets rewritten by the bundler — while this stays parent-context aware, so a genuine Reference Object that merely happens to sit at an entry named `default`/`example`/etc. (a `responses.default`, a map-form `examples` entry, a schema `properties` entry) is still followed and rewritten; (3) the bundler now preserves `summary`/`description` siblings on a Path Item `$ref` (3.1) in both the resolved and unresolved cases instead of dropping them; (4) `nodeAtPosition` now resolves a cursor on a map _key_ (not just its value) to that pair's pointer, fixing hover/definition/rename on a `$ref` (or any) key.

- [#18](https://github.com/Lazialize/oasis/pull/18) [`bb3a169`](https://github.com/Lazialize/oasis/commit/bb3a169ad6345fa0763b438c6e63341b62cc09d9) Thanks [@Lazialize](https://github.com/Lazialize)! - Fix YAML anchor/alias handling across the core walkers and the bundler. Aliased values (`*anchor`, including `<<` merge-key references) were previously invisible to the parser and bundler: a `$ref` reachable only through an alias was never found, duplicate keys inside an aliased map went undetected, pointer traversal couldn't descend through aliases, and the bundler silently dropped aliased keys (e.g. `Derived: *base`) from its output. Aliases are now resolved to their anchored target (with source ranges preserved) before dispatch, guarded against cyclic/self-referential aliases. Also clamp `offsetAtPosition` so out-of-range line/character positions map to the end of the document/line instead of offset 0.

### Minor Changes

- [#14](https://github.com/Lazialize/oasis/pull/14) [`e7bc9c4`](https://github.com/Lazialize/oasis/commit/e7bc9c42099913a43a3449162f3ded39fadba011) Thanks [@Lazialize](https://github.com/Lazialize)! - Breaking changes taken during the pre-1.0 "last window" (see ROADMAP.md's "Definition of 1.0":
  rule names and diagnostic output are frozen at 1.0). If you're pinned to a specific version, read
  this before upgrading:

  - **Severity token**: emitted diagnostics now carry `"warn"` instead of `"warning"` (JSON output,
    pretty output, and the LSP's internal severity mapping). Config already used `"warn"` — this
    only affects code that reads the _emitted_ severity string (e.g. `--format json` consumers).
    SARIF `level` is unaffected (`"warning"` is fixed by the SARIF spec).
  - **Rule renames**: most non-`structure/*` built-in rules are now namespaced, matching
    `structure/*`'s existing `<namespace>/<leaf>` shape. There are no aliases — old names in
    `oasis.config.jsonc` or `# oasis-disable-*` comments now produce an "unknown rule" config
    warning instead of applying. Update any config, suppression comments, or tooling that references
    a rule by name:

    | Old name                     | New name                     |
    | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
    | `no-duplicate-keys`          | `syntax/no-duplicate-keys`   |
    | `no-unresolved-ref`          | `refs/no-unresolved`         |
    | `no-ref-cycle`               | `refs/no-cycle`              |
    | `operation-operationId`      | `operation/operation-id`     |
    | `operation-tags`             | `operation/tags`             |
    | `operation-description`      | `operation/description`      |
    | `operation-success-response` | `operation/success-response` |
    | `path-params-defined`        | `paths/params-defined`       |
    | `no-duplicate-paths`         | `paths/no-duplicates`        |
    | `no-unused-components`       | `components/no-unused`       |
    | `security-defined`           | `security/defined`           |
    | `tags-defined`               | `tags/defined`               |
    | `no-unused-tags`             | `tags/no-unused`             |
    | `naming-convention`          | `style/naming-convention`    |
    | `example-schema-match`       | `examples/schema-match`      |

  - **`oasis/config`**: diagnostics about the configuration or invocation itself (an unknown rule
    name, a declared `entries` path that doesn't exist, …) now use the reserved rule id
    `"oasis/config"` instead of `"config"`. It isn't a real rule — it can't be configured or
    suppressed.
  - **JSON output `file` path**: `oasis lint --format json` now emits `file` relative to
    `process.cwd()` (forward-slashed) when the diagnostic's file is inside the working directory,
    falling back to an absolute path otherwise — matching the existing SARIF `--format sarif`
    behavior. Previously this was always an absolute path. Pretty output (the default) changed the
    same way for consistency.

  Additive, non-breaking in this same release:

  - `oasis lint --help`/`-h` and `oasis bundle --help`/`-h` now print per-command usage and exit 0
    instead of failing with "Unknown flag".
  - Pretty output's summary line now includes the info count alongside errors/warnings.

### Minor Changes

- [#10](https://github.com/Lazialize/oasis/pull/10) [`85ea11a`](https://github.com/Lazialize/oasis/commit/85ea11a4239a185324542b60f80cb3f1a0812d57) Thanks [@Lazialize](https://github.com/Lazialize)! - `oasis bundle --dereference` fully inlines every `$ref` — internal and external — as a deep,
  recursive copy of its resolved target, instead of lifting external refs into `components/*`.
  Components only reachable via a (now-inlined) `$ref` are dropped from the output; components
  unreachable from anywhere are kept verbatim, matching the existing (non-dereferenced) bundle
  behavior for unreferenced entry components. A `$ref` whose expansion would revisit a target
  already being expanded (a reference cycle) can't be inlined: that occurrence is kept as a `$ref`
  to a minimal `components/*` entry for the cycle's target, and a warning diagnostic is emitted
  naming the cycle. Output is deterministic (same input → byte-identical output). The bundler's
  `bundle()` entry point gains an additive `dereference` option (default `false`).
